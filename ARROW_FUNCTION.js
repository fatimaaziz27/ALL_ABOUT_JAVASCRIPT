Arrow Functions allow a shorter syntax for function expressions.

You can skip the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets:

const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
Arrow Functions were introduced in ES6 and are commonly used in modern JavaScript.

Arrow Function Syntax
An arrow function uses the => symbol.

An arrow function is always written as a function expression.

Example
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
This arrow function does the same thing as a regular function expression.

Shorter Syntax
If the function body contains only one statement:

You can remove the word function, the curly brackets and the return keyword.

Before Arrow
Function to compute the product of a and b:

const multiply = function(a, b) {return a * b}

With Arrow
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

With Arrow
const hello = () => "Hello World!";

Before Arrow
const hello = function() {return "Hello World!";}

Arrow Functions with One Parameter
If a function has only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses:

With Parantheses
const square = (x) => x * x;
Without Parantheses
const square = x => x * x;
With Parantheses
const hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;
Without Parantheses
const hello = val => "Hello " + val;
Arrow Functions Return Value by Default
If the function has only one statement that returns a value:

You can remove the brackets and the return keyword:

Example
const hello = () => "Hello World!";

This works only if the function has only one statement.

Arrow Function Parameters
If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:

Example
const hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;

If you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

Example
const hello = val => "Hello " + val;

Arrow Functions with No Parameters
If there are no parameters, parentheses are required.

With Arrow Function:
const hello = () => "Hello World!";

You can only omit the return keyword and the curly brackets if the function is a single statement. Because of this, it might be a good habit to always keep them:

Example
// This will return undefined
const myFunction = (x, y) => { x * y };

// This will return undefined
const myFunction = (x, y) => return x * y;

// This will return the expected result
const myFunction = (x, y) => { return x * y };

REMOVE ADS

Arrow Functions Are Not Declarations
Arrow functions are always expressions and must be assigned to a variable.

They cannot be used before they are defined.

Example
hello(); // Error

const hello = () => "Hello";
Arrow functions must be defined before they are used.

Arrow Functions and the this Keyword
Arrow functions do not have their own this value.

They inherit this from the surrounding code.

Example
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
};
Using an arrow function as a method often gives unexpected results.

Example
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: () => {
    return this.name;
  }
};
In this case, this does not refer to the person object.

When to Use Arrow Functions

For callbacks and array methods
When you do not need your own this
When Not to Use Arrow Functions
As object methods
When you need your own this

Common Mistakes
Forgetting Parentheses Rules
Parentheses are required for zero or multiple parameters.
Using Arrow Functions as Methods
Arrow functions do not bind this.
Expecting Hoisting
Arrow functions are not hoisted.
